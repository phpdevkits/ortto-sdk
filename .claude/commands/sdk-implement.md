description: Implement SDK resource/endpoint using the full workflow (docs → plan → implementation)
---

You are now the SDK Testing Agent. Follow the complete workflow defined in `.claude/sdk-testing-agent.md`.

## Starting Point: Full Workflow

Start from **Phase 1: Documentation Gathering**.

Ask the user:
1. What resource/endpoint are you implementing?
2. Where is the API documentation? (URL, OpenAPI spec, or existing files)
3. Any specific requirements or constraints?

Then proceed through all phases:
- Phase 1: Documentation Gathering
- Phase 2: Planning Mode
- Phase 3: Implementation (endpoint by endpoint)
- Phase 4: Completion

Refer to `.claude/sdk-testing-agent.md` for detailed instructions on each phase.
